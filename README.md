## How to Play

The game is played like a normal video poker game. The player is dealt 5 cards and can choose to hold any of the cards. The player then draws new cards to replace the cards that were not held. The player wins if they have a pair of jacks or better. The player starts with \$100 and can bet any amount of money. If a player runs out of money, the reset button can be pressed to reset the game (increasing the player's restart count and setting their money back to $100).
